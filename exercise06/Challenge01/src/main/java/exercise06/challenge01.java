    * Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the year you can retire.
        It should prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire.
        Display the output as shown in the example that follows.

    * What is your current age? 25
    * At what age would you like to retire? 65
    * You have 40 years left until you can retire.
    * It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055.
    *
    * Constraints:
    * -Again, be sure to convert the input to numerical data before doing any math.
    * -Donâ€™t hard-code the current year into your program. Get it from the system time via your programming language.
    *
    ***CHALLENGE: Handle situations where the program returns a negative number by stating that the user can already retire.***

    *Pseudocode:
    * Prompt user "What is your current age?"
    * scan in user input
    *
    * Prompt user "At what age would you like to retire?"
    * scan in user input
    *
    * convert strings to integers
    *
    * yearsLeft = retirementAge - currentAge
    *
    * get current year from system
    * int retirementYear = currentYear + yearsLeft
    *
    *  if yearsleft > 0
    *   print "You have 'yearsLeft' years left until you can retire."
    *   print "It's 'currentYear', so you can retire in 'retireYear'."
    * else
    *   print "You can already retire!!!"
    *   print "It's 'currentYear', you could have retired in retirementYear'."
