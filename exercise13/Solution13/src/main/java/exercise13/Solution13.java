    /*
     * Write a program to compute the value of an investment compounded over time.
     * The program should ask for the starting amount, the number of years to invest,
     * the interest rate, and the number of periods per year to compound.
     *
     * The formula youâ€™ll use for this is A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t) where
     *
     * -P is the principal amount.
     * -r is the annual rate of interest.
     * -t is the number of years the amount is invested.
     * -n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.
     * -A is the amount at the end of the investment.
     *
     * Example Output:
     * What is the principal amount? 1500
     * What is the rate? 4.3
     * What is the number of years? 6
     * What is the number of times the interest is compounded per year? 4
     * $1500 invested at 4.3% for 6 years compounded 4 times per year is $1938.84.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like 15, not .15). Divide the input by 100 in your program.
     * Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
     * Ensure that the output is formatted as money.
     *
     --------------------
     * Pseudocode:
     * Prompt user "What is the principal amount?"
     * scan in double
     *
     * Prompt user "What is the rate (as a percentage)?"
     * scan in double
     *
     * Prompt user "What is the number of years?"
     * scan in integer
     *
     * Prompt user "What is the number of times the interest is compounded per year?"
     * scan in integer
     *
     * Find end amount = Principal(1 + (rate/periods per year))^(periods per year * years of interest)
     *
     * Print "'principal' invested at 'interestRate' for 'numberYears' years compounded 'periodsPerYear'
     *      times per year is 'endAmount'"
     *
