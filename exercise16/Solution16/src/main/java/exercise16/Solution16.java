    /*
     * Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare it to the legal driving age of sixteen.
     * If the user is sixteen or older, then the program should display "You are old enough to legally drive."
     * If the user is under sixteen, the program should display "You are not old enough to legally drive."
     *
     * Example Output
     * What is your age? 15
     * You are not old enough to legally drive.
     *
     * Or
     *
     * What is your age? 35
     * You are old enough to legally drive.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * -Use a single output statement.
     * -Use a ternary operator to write this program. If your language doesnâ€™t support a ternary operator,
     *     use a regular if/else statement, and still use a single output statement to display the message.
     *
     --------------
     * Pseudocode:
     * declare constant LEGAL_AGE to be 16
     *
     * Prompt user "What is your age?"
     * scan in integer
     *
     * if age >= 16
     *  print "You are old enough to legally drive."
     * else
     *  print "You are not old enough to legally drive."
