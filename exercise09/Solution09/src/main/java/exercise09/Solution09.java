    /*
     * Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room.
     * Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet.
     * Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

     * Example Output
     * "You will need to purchase 2 gallons of paint to cover 360 square feet."
     *
     * Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must
     * round up to the next whole gallon.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * -Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
     * -Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.
     ---------------
     * Pseudocode:
     * prompt user for length of ceiling
     * scan input
     *
     * prompt user for width of ceiling
     * scan input
     *
     * get area = l * w
     * total gallons needed = area / constant
     * round up integer
     *
     * print "You will need to purchase 'totalGallons' gallons of paint to cover 'area' square feet."
